# Medicaid Expansion and the Number of Residency Spots  

This is a project with JR Ang to study the effect of the artificially imposed cap on the number of residency spots in the US by the AMA. This is project will lead to several papers studying the effect of number of doctors on health outcomes, healthcare costs, healthcare access, healthcare quality, healthcare disparities, and other related topics. We will also study the effect of Medicaid expansion on the number of residency spots, and with it the number of doctors in the US. Consequently, we will study the effect of Medicaid expansion on the above health outcomes. 

My to-do list for this project is as follows:
- [ ] Clean and process the data on residency spots
- [ ] Reshape the data to a panel format
- [ ] Run DD analysis using Borusyak, Jaravel, and Spiess (2024) leveraging variation in timing of Medicaid expansion across states on the number of residency spots at the institution/hospital level
- [ ] Run DD analysis using Borusyak, Jaravel, and Spiess (2024) leveraging variation in timing of Medicaid expansion across states on the number of filled residency spots at the institution/hospital level
- [ ] Run the DD analysis by specialty
- [ ] Run DDD analysis on the above regressions by different county characteristics (e.g. rural vs urban, high income vs low income, etc)
